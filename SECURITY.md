# Security Policy

Cha Dash is built to hold credentials for, and eventually control, the machines in your home. We take that seriously.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please don't open a public issue for security problems.**

Report them privately through GitHub's **[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ban-red/Cha-Dash/security/advisories/new)** (Security tab → "Report a vulnerability"). Please include:

- what's affected (hub, node, a specific integration) and which version or commit
- steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept
- what you think the impact is

You'll get an acknowledgement within a few days. Once a fix is ready, we'll coordinate a disclosure date with you and credit you in the advisory unless you'd rather stay anonymous.

## Supported versions

Cha Dash is pre-release, in planning. Once releases begin, security fixes go to the latest release line. This section will be updated then.

## Design commitments

These are tracked as requirements in [docs/plan/03-architecture.md](docs/plan/03-architecture.md#auth-and-security):

- Secrets never reach the browser. They're encrypted at rest and redacted in exports and diagnostics.
- The hub never has write access to Docker. Only nodes do, and only within each host's local policy.
- Every action is authorized centrally and audited.
- No unauthenticated network listeners.
- No third-party JavaScript in the Cha Dash origin.
- Releases will be signed and ship with an SBOM.

A full threat model will be published here before v1.0.

## Test data

Fixtures in this repo must never contain real credentials, domains or IPs. If you find any, please report it privately as described above.
