# 06 · Next Steps: finishing M0

> Where we are (2026-10-03):
> - The plan is written.
> - The repo is public under AGPL-3.0 with an OSI-limited CLA.
> - The importer fixture exists.
> - Design prototype v1 shows both directions.
> - No application code yet.
>
> M0 is done when a live front page runs on Demo Home data in the chosen direction, the layout engine feels right, and decisions 12–17 have ADRs ([04 · Roadmap](04-roadmap.md#m0-foundations)).

**House rule:** builds and dev servers only run when you say so. Every step below that needs one marks it with **▶ you run**, or with "tell me to run it".

## The critical path

```
Pick direction (12) ──▶ Prototype v2 + tokens v0 ──┐
                                                    ├──▶ M0 demo: live front page on Demo Home ──▶ M0 review → v0.1
Layout engine package ──▶ Vue renderer ────────────┤
                                                    │
Hub skeleton + Demo Home sim ───────────────────────┘
Plumbing spikes (your lab, read-only) ──▶ fixtures + ADRs 14–15 (feed v0.1, not the M0 demo)
```

Four of these tracks can run **in parallel**: design, layout engine, hub and simulator, and spikes. Parallel agents in separate git worktrees work well for this.

---

## Track 0: Housekeeping (small, do first)

| # | Task | Who | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | Enable **private vulnerability reporting** (repo Settings → Security) | **you** | `SECURITY.md` link works |
| 0.2 | Create the `cla-signatures` branch the CLA bot writes to | me | branch on origin |
| 0.3 | Write **ADR-0001 to ADR-0011** for the decisions already made (name, license + CLA, Vue, dogfood, v0.1 scope, owned stacks + node, compose-first, repo/images, port, Unraid stays Unraid, PWA-only) | me | `docs/adr/` |
| 0.4 | Issue templates (bug, integration request, design feedback), labels, `CODEOWNERS` | me | `.github/` |
| 0.5 | **Go module path:** `github.com/ban-red/Cha-Dash` or a vanity `dash.cha.sh`. The vanity path needs a `go-import` meta tag served at `https://dash.cha.sh`. It's prettier and survives repo moves | **you decide** | ADR-0018 |

## Track 1: Design (decides how everything looks)

| # | Task | Output | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | **Review prototype v1 and pick A, B or a blend** (decision 12). Note what felt wrong | your notes | Direction chosen |
| 1.2 | **Prototype v2** in the chosen direction: <ul><li>first-run and empty states</li><li>Inbox repairs flow</li><li>motion study (expand in place, reflow springs, hold ring, lens fade)</li><li>night and phone polish</li><li>the "simplified" wall detail level for 3 widgets</li></ul> | `design/prototypes/m0-v2.html` | You'd ship the look |
| 1.3 | **Tokens v0**: OKLCH 12-step scales per theme, type scale, spacing, radii and motion tokens, exported as CSS variables. Status pairs re-validated with the palette validator, and APCA checks on text | `design/tokens/` → `web/src/design/tokens.css` | Validator and contrast checks pass |
| 1.4 | Seed the **Workbench** list: every v0.1 widget × size × state it must support | `docs/design/workbench.md` | Agreed list |

## Track 2: Layout engine spike (independent; can start now)

| # | Task | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | **`packages/layout`** (pure TypeScript, framework-agnostic): <ul><li>model: sections; items with `supportedSizes`</li><li>operations: place, move, resize-to-size, remove, smart insert</li><li>dense Z-reflow; derived breakpoints (12 → 8 → 4 columns)</li><li>immutable history (undo/redo); serialization</li></ul> | package + API doc |
| 2.2 | **Property tests** (fast-check): <ul><li>no overlaps; all items in bounds</li><li>derivation is deterministic</li><li>undo restores exactly</li><li>resizing only ever lands on supported sizes</li></ul> | green test suite |
| 2.3 | **Vue 3.6 renderer**: pointer drag with momentum projection, Motion for Vue springs, a corner resize handle that snaps, keyboard move and resize, edit mode | `web/` demo route |
| 2.4 | **One-day gridstack 14 comparison** on the same scenarios | ADR-0013 |
| 2.5 | Feel check on a real phone: 60 fps drag | ▶ you run the dev server |

## Track 3: Hub skeleton and the Demo Home simulator

| # | Task | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Toolchain: update Go to the current stable release (local is 1.25.1); Node 24 + pnpm are already present | — |
| 3.2 | **`cmd/chadash`**: `serve`, `healthcheck`, `version`; config from env and flags; structured logs | binary |
| 3.3 | **Storage**: SQLite plus goose migrations, schema v0 (settings, users, sessions, integration instances, vault, boards, layouts, audit stub) | migrations |
| 3.4 | **First run**: setup token printed to logs → owner account → session cookie. Passkeys follow in v0.1 | auth flow |
| 3.5 | **Vault**: XChaCha20-Poly1305 envelope encryption; key auto-generated on first boot or loaded from `CHADASH_SECRET_KEY_FILE` | `internal/vault` |
| 3.6 | **Home Graph v0 + realtime**: an in-memory graph, and the WebSocket protocol (`hello` / `sub` / `snap` / `diff` / `ping`) from the architecture doc | `internal/graph`, `internal/realtime` |
| 3.7 | **Demo Home simulator v0** (`sim/`): the dogfood topology (5 PVE endpoints, Unraid with PBS, pvedocker, OPNsense, HA, Frigate) plus scripted incidents (PBS filling up, failed backup, memory pressure, Plex token revoked, Karakeep API change, OOM-killed qBittorrent). It also exports JSON snapshots so later prototypes use the same data | `sim/` |
| 3.8 | **`web/` scaffold**: Vue 3.6 + Vite SPA embedded with `go:embed`; one live page subscribed to the simulator over the WebSocket | SPA |
| 3.9 | **Ship shape**: multi-stage Dockerfile (scratch, non-root, `/data`), `deploy/compose.yaml` with the socket-proxy preset | ▶ you run `docker compose up -d` |
| 3.10 | **CI**: go vet/test/govulncheck; pnpm lint/typecheck/test; image build (no push); bundle-size budget. Then turn on branch protection for `main` | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

## Track 4: Plumbing spikes against your lab

All **read-only**, time-boxed, throwaway code. Each produces notes plus **sanitized recorded fixtures** that seed the v0.1 integrations.

| # | Spike | Against | Also settles |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | PVE multi-instance + cluster: `/cluster/resources`, tasks, check that privilege separation is in effect | your 5 PVE endpoints | — |
| 4.2 | Unraid: GraphQL introspection, subscriptions, `ApiKeyAuthorize` consent flow | jupiter | — |
| 4.3 | Traefik routers, including path-based ones (`/sonarr`) → service URL correlation | pvedocker Traefik | — |
| 4.4 | Docker through the socket proxy: list, inspect (with env redaction), events, and a proxy-vs-raw probe | both proxies | — |
| 4.5 | OPNsense SSE traffic stream; Frigate events and snapshots | router, minig5 | — |
| 4.6 | **Node prototype**: Compose SDK + go-git deploy → diff → health gate → rollback | a **sandbox** Docker LXC, never a production host | — |
| 4.7 | Node transport: mTLS vs Noise (ergonomics, rotation, code size) | local | ADR-0014 |
| 4.8 | SQLite driver: modernc vs ncruces (encryption cost, performance) | local | ADR-0015 |

Credentials for the spikes:
- **Dedicated `chadash` tokens.** Create a PVEAuditor token per PVE host, separate from Homepage's, so each can be revoked on its own. Unraid gets its key through the consent flow.
- **Stored only in a git-ignored local file** (`.env.local`). They never appear in commits, fixtures or chat.

## Suggested order

1. **Now:** Track 0. You review the prototype and pick a direction (1.1).
2. **Next, in parallel:**
   - Layout engine (2.1–2.2).
   - Hub skeleton + simulator (3.1–3.7).
   - Prototype v2 + tokens (1.2–1.3), once the direction is chosen.
3. **Then:**
   - Renderer (2.3–2.5).
   - SPA + compose + CI (3.8–3.10).
   - Spikes 4.1–4.5 alongside.
4. **M0 demo:** the live front page on simulator data, in the chosen direction with tokens v0, editable with the layout engine, served by `docker compose up -d`.
5. **M0 review:** write ADRs 12–17 (direction, grid engine, node transport, SQLite driver, hardware floor, AI/MCP stance) plus 18 (module path), run the node spike (4.6), then start **v0.1**.

## What I need from you

| When | What |
|---|---|
| Now | Click through prototype v1 and pick a direction, with notes on anything that felt off |
| Now | Enable private vulnerability reporting |
| Now | Choose the Go module path (repo path vs `dash.cha.sh` vanity) |
| Before spikes | Create dedicated read-only `chadash` tokens and put them in a local `.env.local` |
| Before the node spike | A sandbox Docker LXC we're allowed to break |
| During Tracks 2–3 | Say "run it" when you want me to start dev servers or builds |
