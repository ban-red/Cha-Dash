# Cha Dash

**The front page of your home.**
One calm, beautiful page that tells you everything's fine — and lets you fix it, safely, when it isn't.

> Status: **planning** (October 2026). No code yet — the research and product plan are below. Repo: [github.com/ban-red/Cha-Dash](https://github.com/ban-red/Cha-Dash)

Cha Dash is an open-source, self-hosted dashboard for homelabs. Unraid, Docker and Proxmox are supported first-class. It starts as one customizable page of live widgets, and grows into safe control of your containers, stacks, VMs and LXCs, snapshots, updates and backups, across every host you run.

```bash
docker compose up -d   # the primary way to self-host Cha Dash (coming soon) — then open http://<host>:3696
```

## The Pact (draft)

- **Open source (AGPL-3.0), built in the open** for the homelab community.
- **Your secrets never leave the server.**
- **Read-only until you say otherwise.**
- **No cloud, no phoning home.**
- **Your config and your stacks are yours.** Export config as YAML; your compose files live on your disks, in git.
- **Small and simple to run.** One `docker compose up -d`, under 100 MB of RAM.
- **Accessible.** Meeting WCAG 2.2 AA is required for every release.
